# Carbide

Carbide is a new experimental notebook programming environment, inspired by Jupyter, Swift Playground, Light Table and Mathematica. 

Programming is ultimately linguistic communication with a computer, and for a future with more effective communication, it makes sense to look at what makes human communication effective. There really isn't any mode of  communication more effective than conversationâ€” the rapid back and forth between two parties, because it enables the interactive resolution of ambiguity and intent. 

Naturally, communication is a sort of feedback loop, where the programmer enters something and gets some form of response. With typical compiled languages this may involve a lengthy compilation process, something which has been improved upon by interpreted languages. The REPL (read-eval-print-loop) further shortens the feedback loop, but when running from a regular terminal window, it lacks rich output formatting, syntax highlighting, and critically the ability to modify previous inputs without cluttering an append-only buffer. Notebooks are a neat generaliztion of REPLs, substituting lines of input with blocks and adding multiple content types.
